# Technical Decisions and Justifications

## Backend Framework: Hono.js

### Choice Justification
We selected **Hono.js** as our backend framework for the following reasons:

1. **Performance**: Hono is one of the fastest web frameworks available, with benchmarks showing superior performance compared to Express.js and Fastify
2. **TypeScript-first**: Built with TypeScript from the ground up, providing excellent type safety
3. **Edge-ready**: Can run on various JavaScript runtimes (Node.js, Deno, Bun, Cloudflare Workers)
4. **Lightweight**: Minimal dependencies and small bundle size
5. **Modern**: Uses Web Standard APIs, making it future-proof

### Scalability Benefits
- Efficient request handling with minimal overhead
- Supports middleware composition for clean code organization
- Easy horizontal scaling due to stateless design
- Compatible with serverless deployments

## Database: Turso (LibSQL) / SQLite

### Choice Justification
We selected **Turso** (a distributed SQLite-compatible database) for:

1. **Simplicity**: SQLite's familiar SQL syntax with ACID compliance
2. **Performance**: Edge-native with low latency global replication
3. **Scalability**: Unlike traditional SQLite, Turso supports:
   - Multi-region replication
   - Automatic backups
   - Read replicas for scaling read operations
4. **Cost-effective**: Serverless pricing model, pay only for what you use
5. **Developer Experience**: Excellent local development story with SQLite compatibility

### Trade-offs Considered
- **Pros**: Zero-config, edge-ready, SQLite compatibility, cost-effective
- **Cons**: Less suitable for write-heavy workloads compared to PostgreSQL
- **Decision**: For a transaction management system with moderate write loads and heavy read operations, Turso provides the best balance

## Architecture: Hexagonal Architecture

### Implementation Benefits
1. **Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between business logic and infrastructure
2. **Testability**: Business logic can be tested independently of external dependencies
3. **Flexibility**: Easy to swap implementations (e.g., change database, add new API protocols)
4. **Maintainability**: Changes in one layer don't cascade to others

### Layer Breakdown
- **Domain Layer** (`domain/`): Pure business logic, no external dependencies
- **Application Layer** (services): Orchestrates use cases
- **Infrastructure Layer** (repositories): Database access, external services
- **Presentation Layer** (routers): API endpoints, request/response handling

## API Design: Dual API Strategy (ORPC + REST)

### ORPC Benefits
1. **End-to-end Type Safety**: Automatic type inference from backend to frontend
2. **No Code Generation**: Unlike GraphQL, no build step required
3. **Simple Mental Model**: Just functions, no need to think about HTTP methods
4. **Efficient**: Minimal overhead, direct function calls
5. **Perfect for TypeScript Projects**: Seamless integration with TypeScript frontends

### REST API Benefits
1. **Universal Compatibility**: Works with any client (mobile apps, third-party integrations)
2. **Industry Standard**: Well-understood by all developers
3. **Tool Support**: Works with Postman, Swagger, curl, etc.
4. **Caching**: HTTP caching mechanisms work out of the box
5. **API Documentation**: Easy to document and test

### Implementation Strategy
We implemented both APIs to maximize flexibility:
- **ORPC** (`/rpc/*`): Primary API for our TypeScript frontend
- **REST** (`/api/v1/*`): Secondary API for external integrations

Both APIs share the same business logic layer (hexagonal architecture), ensuring consistency and reducing code duplication. The REST API follows best practices:
- Semantic HTTP methods (GET, POST, PATCH)
- Proper status codes (200, 201, 400, 404, 409, 500)
- Consistent error format
- Request validation with Zod
- Middleware for CORS, logging, and pretty JSON

## Frontend Framework: TanStack Start

### Advantages
1. **Modern React**: Latest React features with Server Components support
2. **Type-safe Routing**: File-based routing with full TypeScript support
3. **Built-in Data Fetching**: TanStack Query integration out of the box
4. **Performance**: Automatic code splitting and optimized bundling
5. **Developer Experience**: Hot module replacement, error boundaries

## Testing Strategy: Vitest

### Why Vitest
1. **Speed**: Faster than Jest due to native ESM support
2. **Compatibility**: Jest-compatible API for easy migration
3. **Integration**: Works seamlessly with Vite ecosystem
4. **Features**: Built-in mocking, coverage, and UI mode

## Security Considerations

### Data Protection
1. **Card Number Storage**: Only last 4 digits stored, never full card numbers
2. **Input Validation**: Zod schemas on all API endpoints
3. **SQL Injection Prevention**: Parameterized queries via Drizzle ORM
4. **Type Safety**: TypeScript prevents many runtime errors

### Future Enhancements
1. **Authentication**: Can add JWT/OAuth integration
2. **Rate Limiting**: Middleware can be added to Hono
3. **Audit Logging**: Transaction history tracking
4. **Encryption**: Sensitive data encryption at rest

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Database Indexing**: Indexes on frequently queried fields (categoryId, status, date)
2. **Query Optimization**: Efficient joins for expense summaries
3. **Caching**: TanStack Query caching on frontend
4. **Bundle Size**: Tree-shaking and code splitting

## Deployment Strategy

### Backend
- **Recommended**: Edge deployment (Cloudflare Workers, Vercel Edge)
- **Alternative**: Traditional Node.js hosting (Railway, Render)
- **Database**: Turso handles global distribution automatically

### Frontend
- **Static Hosting**: Vercel, Netlify, Cloudflare Pages
- **CDN**: Automatic with most modern hosting providers
- **Asset Optimization**: Vite handles bundling and optimization

## Monitoring and Observability

### Recommendations
1. **APM**: Integration with services like Datadog or New Relic
2. **Error Tracking**: Sentry for error monitoring
3. **Logging**: Structured logging with correlation IDs
4. **Metrics**: Response times, error rates, business metrics

## Conclusion

The chosen technology stack provides an excellent balance of:
- **Performance**: Fast runtime performance and development speed
- **Scalability**: Can grow from prototype to production
- **Maintainability**: Clean architecture and type safety
- **Cost-effectiveness**: Serverless-ready with pay-per-use options
- **Developer Experience**: Modern tooling and excellent DX

This architecture can handle the current requirements while being flexible enough to accommodate future growth and feature additions.
